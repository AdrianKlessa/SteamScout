Planned features (implemented / unimplemented):

- ✅ Initial dataset analysis
- ✅ Script for description vectorization
- ✅ Script for tag vectorization
- ✅ Database to store game vectors
- ✅ "Similar game" lookup
  - ✅ Description vector-based recommender
  - ✅ Tag vector-based recommender
  - ✅ User reviews (score) as factor
- ✅ Game search by name
- ✅ Add filtering by tags during query
- ✅ "Hidden gems" search by limiting to games with low review count
- ✅ Increases number of search results when using filters
- ✅ Configurable influence of each recommender in ensemble
- ✅ Frontend
  - ✅ Website?
- ✅ Dockerfile
- ✅ Frontend improvements
  - ✅ Better link formatting
  - ✅ Overall recommendation score (the one which was used to rank the game)
  - ✅ Less clicking (esp. Enter) to search for a single game (use button instead maybe?)
- ✅ Architecture diagram to add to docs


Notes:
- Code for game search by description was added but didn't work too well with the embeddings generated by doc2vec. 
It's possible that the document length has a lot of influence over the vectorization so mapping user queries to descriptions is not trivial.
- Decided not to add game thumbnails due to either having to store them locally or using too many requests to Steam API
