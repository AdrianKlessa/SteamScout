Planned features (implemented / unimplemented):

- âœ… Initial dataset analysis
- âœ… Script for description vectorization
- âœ… Script for tag vectorization
- âœ… Database to store game vectors
- âœ… "Similar game" lookup
  - âœ… Description vector-based recommender
  - âœ… Tag vector-based recommender
  - âœ… User reviews (score) as factor
- âœ… Game search by name
- âœ… Add filtering by tags during query
- âœ… "Hidden gems" search by limiting to games with low review count
- âœ… Increases number of search results when using filters
- âœ… Configurable influence of each recommender in ensemble
- âœ… Frontend
  - âœ… Website?
- âœ… Dockerfile
- âœ… Frontend improvements
  - âœ… Better link formatting
  - âœ… Overall recommendation score (the one which was used to rank the game)
  - âœ… Less clicking (esp. Enter) to search for a single game (use button instead maybe?)
- ðŸ”³ Architecture diagram to add to docs

To fix:

- Remove `games_with_vectors.pickle` and `games.csv` when they're no longer needed when building the docker image.


Notes:
- Code for game search by description was added but didn't work too well with the embeddings generated by doc2vec. 
It's possible that the document length has a lot of influence over the vectorization so mapping user queries to descriptions is not trivial.
- Decided not to add game thumbnails due to either having to store them locally or using too many requests to Steam API
