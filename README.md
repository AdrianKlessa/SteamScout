### A similarity search and recommendation system for finding games on Steam

***Find similar games to the ones you like - even if the genres you like are not very popular***

The system is a weighted ensemble recommender composed of:
- A recommender rating the games based on the similarity of their vectorized descriptions ("About this game" section)
- A recommender rating the similarity of games based on their tags
- A simple check for the ratio of positive user reviews to negative

Since this ensemble does not take into account the number of reviews (only the fraction of positive ones), it tends to catch games with very few reviews if they appear to be a good match to the one the user searched for.

Both the tags and descriptions are compared based on the cosine similarity of their vectors. 

The tags are binary vectors (consisting of 1s at the indices matching a particular tag the game has and 0s for tags it lacks). The description vector is generated by using doc2vec after training on the entire dataset.

The vectors are stored using [vectordb](https://github.com/jina-ai/vectordb/) for easy Approximate Nearest Neighbor search.

[Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) is used to generate a frontend for the system.
